# kontra.tel

kontra.tel is a small developer collective and a playground for software and technology projects.
The goal is to build useful, high-quality solutions — sometimes open source, sometimes not.

The focus is on learning, experimentation, and doing.
Projects range from small tools and concepts to larger, more complex ideas and sometimes just fun things we feel like building.

New ideas and collaboration are always welcome.
